const { describe, it } = require('mocha');
const { expect } = require('chai');
Certainly, here's a basic structure that leverages AI capabilities. For the sake of brevity, we're only creating a simple test to fetch the title of www.google.com. The intelligence lies in its ability to learn and adapt, for instance by identifying patterns over time and making informed decisions about what elements of the page to test.

```javascript
// Import necessary libraries
const assert = require('assert');
const axios = require('axios');
const cheerio = require('cheerio');
const mocha = require('mocha');

// The AI-powered testing module
const AITestModule = require('./AITestModule');

// Describe the test suite
mocha.describe('AI-Powered Test Suite', function() {
    
    // This is our learning and adapting test case
    mocha.it('Fetches www.google.com title', async function() {
        
        // Fetch the HTML content of www.google.com
        const response = await axios.get('https://www.google.com');
        
        // Use cheerio library to parse HTML content and select title tag
        const $ = cheerio.load(response.data);
        const title = $('title').text();
        
        // Here we use AI to learn from testing behavior. Over time, it should be able to identify which parts of 
        //the page are more likely to change and thus require testing.
        AITestModule.learnFromTestBehavior(title);
        
        // Expected title - this would usually be stored in a database or file so it can be changed easily
        const expectedTitle = 'Google';
        
        //  Assertion - if the fetched title differs from expected, report an error. This is also a learning 
        //opportunity for the AI.
        try {
            assert.strictEqual(title, expectedTitle);
            AITestModule.registerSuccessfulTest(title);
       } catch(error) {
            AITestModule.registerUnsuccessfulTest(title, error);
            throw error;
       }
    });
    
    // More tests would be written here. Each test would contribute to the AI's learning.
}); 
```
 
Please note that AITestModule is a hypothetical module that represents the AI capabilities in our test suite. It could contain methods to analyze and learn from test behaviors and outcomes, making future testing more efficient and effective.

You would also need to install any necessary libraries with NPM or Yarn, such as Axios for HTTP requests and Cheerio for HTML parsing.
